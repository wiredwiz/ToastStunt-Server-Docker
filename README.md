## This is my project I use for building my ToastStunt docker image
I have changed the different build files to use multi-stage builds, greatly compressing the number of layers to save space.  
You may find the actual image/tags in the Docker registry at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wiredwizard/toaststunt
